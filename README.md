### Raspberrypi

Theses are all the project that I'm currently devloping / using / keeping updated : 
- A discord bot
- A web server, using Nginx + Unicorn with a Flask backend.
- A MariaDB server to save an view data (With one DB for the Discord Bot and an other one for the WEB)
- Some scripts to create backups and monitor the performances
