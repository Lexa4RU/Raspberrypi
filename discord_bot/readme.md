### Discord Bot
This discord bot project was initially made to act as a reminder for twitch drops, but it ended up being a lot of different things such as : 
- Time checker, sending the time of the machine it's on
- reminder (create, edit, view and delete them)
- timestamp creator with all the possible modifiers usable in discord
- cleaner, will clean all the messages of the bot and all of his commands

I used it as well, to create some small programs via commands, since it's python it's very easy to make small changes and add new features.
